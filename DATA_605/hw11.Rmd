# loading cars dataset

# linear model

```{r}
model = lm(dist~speed,cars)
```

# scatter plot

#### at first glance, the scatter plot shows a clear positive correlation between speed and distance

```{r}
ggplot(cars,aes(x = speed,y=dist))+geom_point(stat= 'identity')+labs(title = 'Speed vs Distance') + geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y~x)
```

# quality of model

#### speeds p value of 1.49e-12 indicates that there is high confidence that speed is a good predictor of distance 

```{r}
summary(model)

```

# qqplot

#### the residuals from our model for the most part follows the diagonal line which indicates normality 

```{r}
qqnorm(resid(model))
qqline(resid(model))
```
