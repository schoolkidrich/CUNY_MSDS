# a

```{r}
win = 0.4
lose = 0.6
ratio = lose/win

for (i in seq(8)){
  
  Prob = (1-ratio^i)/(1-ratio^8)
  print(Prob)
}
```

# b

```{r}
# Since the only way he can win with method b is to get 3 wins in a row
win = 0.4
probability = win^3
```

# c: He has a better probability of getting out of jail using the second method.
