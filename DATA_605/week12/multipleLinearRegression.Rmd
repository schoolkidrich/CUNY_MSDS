```{r}
# variance of residuals clusters around 0 
plot(fitted(m1),(resid(m1)))
```

# qqplot 

```{r}
# qq plot shows that the residuals are normal
qqnorm(resid(m1))

```

# Conclusion:
#### Given the normal residuals, and average residuals being close to 0 I think a multiple linear model is appropriate for this dataset
